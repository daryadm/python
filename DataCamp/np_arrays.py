####Loop over Numpy array
####If you're dealing with a 2D Numpy array, it's more complicated.
#  A 2D array is built up of multiple 1D arrays.
# To explicitly iterate over all separate elements of a multi-dimensional array,
#  you'll need this syntax:

#for x in np.nditer(my_array) :
 #   ...

# Import numpy as np
import numpy as np

# For loop over np_height
for h in np_height:
    print(str(h) + " inches")

# For loop over np_baseball
for h in np.nditer(np_baseball):
    print(h)

# Import cars data
import pandas as pd

cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col=0)

# Adapt for loop
for lab, row in cars.iterrows():
    print(lab)
    print(row)

# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Adapt for loop
for lab, row in cars.iterrows() :
    print(str(lab) + ": " + str(row["cars_per_cap"]))

# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Code for loop that adds COUNTRY column
for lab, row in cars.iterrows():
    cars.loc[lab, "COUNTRY"] = row["country"].upper()


# Print cars
print(cars)

# Import cars data
import pandas as pd

cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col=0)

# Use .apply(str.upper)
for lab, row in cars.iterrows():
    cars.loc[lab, "COUNTRY"] = row["country"].upper()

cars["COUNTRY"] = cars['country'].apply(str.upper)
